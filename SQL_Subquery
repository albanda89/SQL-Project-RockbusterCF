### SQL-Subquery

### Using SQL-subquering to find out the average amount paid by the top 5 customers 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount_paid.total_amount_paid),4) AS average_total_amount_paid
FROM (SELECT  B.customer_id,
              B.first_name AS Customer_first_Name,
              B.last_name AS Customer_last_Name,
              E.country,
              D.city,
              SUM(A.amount) AS Total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de
                Goinia','Emeishan','Pontianak','Tarsus','Atlixco','Zalantun',
                'Rio Claro','Tokat')
GROUP BY  B.customer_id,
          B.first_name,
          B.last_name,
          E.country,
          D.city
ORDER BY Total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid





### Using Subquering to find out top 5 customers based within each country.

SELECT  X.country,
        X.all_customer_count,
        COUNT( Y.country)
FROM (SELECT  B.customer_id,
              B.first_name AS Customer_first_Name,
              B.last_name AS Customer_last_Name,
              E.country,
              D.city,
              SUM(A.amount) AS Total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de
                Goinia','Emeishan','Pontianak','Tarsus','Atlixco','Zalantun',
                'Rio Claro','Tokat')
GROUP BY  B.customer_id,
          B.first_name,
          B.last_name,
          E.country,
          D.city
ORDER BY Total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) Y
LEFT JOIN (SELECT D.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS all_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id= B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country) X ON Y.country = X.country
GROUP By  X.country,
